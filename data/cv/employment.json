          "I led the development of [AnnoTate](https://anno.tate.org.uk/), a web application enabling the collaborative transcription of works in the Tate Museums' archives. This uses a custom Rails REST API for the back-end and data aggregation, Angular, Stylus and Gulp. The code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/zooniverse/AnnoTate).",
          "I also contributed significantly to two other transcription projects: [Shakespeare's World](http://www.shakespearesworld.org/), in connection with the Folger Shakespeare Library, and [Old Weather](http://www.oldweather.org/), with the Meterological Office. Additionally, through my work on these projects I won a Â£50,000 research grant to study building citizen science projects on Facebook.",
